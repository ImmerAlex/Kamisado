# Kamisado

### Game System:

- **Board and Pieces**: The game is played on an 8x8 board with each square having a unique color. Each player has 8
  towers, each corresponding to one of the board's colors.

- **Objective**: The goal is to be the first player to move one of your towers to the opponent's starting row.

- **Movement**: Towers move straight forward or diagonally forward, but never sideways or backward.

- **Turn Mechanics**: The color of the square where your opponent's tower lands determines which of your towers you must
  move next. For instance, if your opponent ends their turn on a red square, you must move your red tower on your next
  turn.

- **Winning**: The first player to move one of their towers to the opponent's back row wins the game.

### Strategy:

Players must think ahead and consider not only their own moves but also how those moves will influence their opponent's
options. Effective planning and strategic foresight are key to victory in Kamisado.
